  <h1>API Aces - Card Game</h1>
  <span>Project for Module 321</span>
</div>

## Description

This project is a small card game that can be played from 2 to 4 players. The aim is to lay down different API Method cards to change the behavior of the game. The game can get very chaotic and difficult to follow, but that is the fun part of it.

## Rules

The game rules are listed on [here](https://api-aces.geeler.dev/rules).

## Project documentation

The project documentation is available in [the wiki](/Nevah5/m321-api-aces/wiki) of this repository.
